# socket-chat
The Net Ninja's Original Basic Tutorial (just the room chat ability) inspired me to add a few more features to the chat room.
Added private message, online status, persistent storage, and status broadcasting features; slightly modified the CSS as well. For a technical writeup, see this link from socket.io:
