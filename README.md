# socket-chat
The Net Ninja's Original Basic Tutorial (just the room chat ability) inspired me to add more features to the chat room.
Added persistent storage as well as private messaging, multiple chat rooms, and online statuses; slightly modified the CSS as well. For a technical writeup, see this link from socket.io:
